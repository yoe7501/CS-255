README File: Reflection on the DriverPass Project
Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named Liam, who wanted to offer better driver training through online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road lessons. The goal was to create a web-based platform to manage scheduling, reservations, and compliance with DMV regulations.

What I Did Well
I effectively translated the client’s needs into clear UML diagrams, which provided a solid foundation for the system design. These diagrams helped ensure that all functional requirements were clearly understood and addressed.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, it would be the technical requirements section. I would add more details on scalability and future-proofing the system, such as load balancing and seamless upgrade strategies.

Interpreting User Needs
I focused on understanding and implementing the client’s needs by creating detailed diagrams that mapped out user interactions and system functionality. Considering user needs is crucial to ensure the system is both functional and user-friendly.

Design Approach
My approach to software design starts with thorough requirement gathering and visualization using UML diagrams. In the future, I plan to use more iterative and agile methods to incorporate continuous feedback, ensuring the system evolves with user needs.
